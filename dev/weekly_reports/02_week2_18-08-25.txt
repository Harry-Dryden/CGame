============
Week Actions:
Action: Draft 1
Coded an initial draft for the game as a prototype, giving me an idea of where I want to go with the project
Action: Writing the Design document
Started the Design document, basing it off my initial prototype and starting to plan a second draft as well as my initial ideas for a final product
I also added a bit more to the project aims, although for now this is a simple document as my aims are quite simple
